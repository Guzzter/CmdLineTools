            Search for files in [sourcedir] and tries to determine in which subdir of the [targetdir] it should be copied.
            Does a testrun first and then asks for permission
            
            Example subdir in [targetdir]: 'e:\targetdir\series - South Park (sp.,sp-,south)'
            Extracted rules: Move every file that
             - contains 'South Park' or 'SouthPark' or 'South-Park' or 'South_Park' or 'South.Park' 
             - starts with 'sp.' or 'sp-' or 'south'
            Note that matches are case-insensitive and that 'series - ' is not mandatory and is not used.
